description = """The NGS FSM Assembly is responsible for configuring the FSM to dither and modulate the beam on the Pyramid Wavefront Sensor (PWFS). The motion of the FSM must be tightly coupled with the exposer on the PWFS, i.e. the modulation pattern must make a full cycle each exposer frame, while the dither signal must make a full cycle over an integer number of exposer frames. To achieve this the FSM controller is trigger by the same signal generated that triggers an exposer on the PWFS."""
